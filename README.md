### Trello

I used Trello to make a thorough plan of all the tasks I had to do. It allowed me to keep track and to keep on top of what I needed to do. The screenshot below was taken early on in the project.

### Challenges and Problems

- It was challenging at first to figure out the step-by-step process of building the app and inputting this into my Trello board.

-  If a user registered as a charity, I found it difficult to display (on the charity show page) nearby vendors offering food within a 3000m radius of the charity's location. It required a change in the donations controller.

- The functionality behind a logged in charity user being able to click on a vendor icon and route to their show page was also more difficult than I originally expected. 

---

### Wins

- At the beginning of each day I would plan out my goals and try to hit my targets for the day. This way, I was able to keep to a strict schedule and meet MVP after 4 days of working.

- I am proud of all the functionality I have produced in the project as well as the styling.

---

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- Include a comments section/messaging platform so vendors and charities can communicate over the application.

- Link the app to city mapper so that users can get a route from their current location to the event.
